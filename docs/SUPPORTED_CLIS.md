# Supported CLIs

Career-ops is AI-agnostic and runs on several command-line agent tools. The core logic is shared via `AGENTS.md`, while CLI-specific nuances are handled through entry wrappers in the repository root.

| CLI | Entry File | How to Invoke |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Claude Code | `CLAUDE.md` | Interactive: `claude` (then `/career-ops`). Headless/Batch: `claude -p "prompt"` |
| Codex | `CODEX.md` (see [`docs/CODEX.md`](CODEX.md)) | Interactive: `codex` (then use plain text). Headless/Batch: `codex exec "prompt"` |
| OpenCode | `OPENCODE.md` (imports `AGENTS.md`) | Interactive: `opencode` (then `/career-ops`). Headless/Batch: `opencode run "prompt"` |
| Antigravity CLI | `AGENTS.md` | Interactive: `agy` (then `/career-ops`). Headless/Batch: `agy -p "prompt"` |
| Grok Build CLI | `AGENTS.md` | Interactive: `grok` (then `/career-ops`). Headless/Batch: `grok -p "prompt"` |
| Qwen | `AGENTS.md` | Interactive: `qwen`. Headless/Batch: `qwen -p "prompt"` |
| Kimi | `KIMI.md` (imports `AGENTS.md`) | Interactive: `kimi` |
| GitHub Copilot CLI | `AGENTS.md` | Headless/Batch: `copilot -p "prompt"` |
| Gemini | `GEMINI.md` | Legacy no-op guard; use the Antigravity `AGENTS.md` entrypoint. |

Career-ops does not maintain a closed catalogue of model IDs. Any CLI/model label can
be recorded in generation provenance; users may keep the release policy open or set
an exact personal allowlist in `config/profile.yml`. See [MODEL_SELECTION.md](MODEL_SELECTION.md)
for the recommended quality/cost policy before choosing a provider's smallest model.
